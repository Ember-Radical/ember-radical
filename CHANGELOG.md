## 1.8.0 (06-29-2017) Alerts, Buttons, Cards and SVG with Bootstrap

Release 1.8.0 includes prep work and deprecation to prepare these elements for v2
including:

#### Bootstrap

Bootstrap v4 is a dependency of Ember Radical, it can now be imported through your
node_modules. For example if you're using `ember-cli-sass-loader` you would set
the following options in your `ember-cli-build.js` config:

```javascript
sassOptions: {
  extension: 'scss',
  includePaths: ['node_modules/bootstrap/scss']
},
```

#### Alerts

- Deprecated: `canDismiss` is deprecated and should be replaced with `dismissible`
- Deprecated: `onDismiss` is deprecated and should be replaced with `onDeactivate`
- Added: class `.alert`
- Added: hook `onDeactivated`

#### Buttons

- Addition of `btn-unstyled` class bound to `link=true`. The intent of `link=true` is
  to create a button that looks/behaves just like a link element, and currently
  `btn-link` maintains the padding/margin of a button if addon is used with Bootstrap.
  In 2.0 styles will be introduced to remove that padding. If a traditional Bootstrap
  'link button' is needed, then class `btn-link` can be used.

New Button CSS that can be included now:

```css
.btn-unstyled {
  -webkit-appearance: none; // Remove Chrome native button styling
  white-space: normal;
  line-height: $line-height-base;
  vertical-align: baseline;
  user-select: auto;
  border: none;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: $font-family-sans-serif;
}
```

#### Cards

Deprecated:

- Contextual card `body` is deprecated and being replaced with `block`
- Class `card-default` is deprecated and will be removed in v2
- card class props are deprecated. If you need to pass class names use a contextual
  component

#### SVG

- Added: class `'.icon'`

#### General

- Fixed `.aria-hidden` classes to work with all elements

## 1.7.1 (06-01-2017)

Fixed:

- Addon overwriting UglifyJS `global_defs` through shallow Object.assign

## 1.7.0 (05-18-2017)

Added:

- Button component `outline` prop for outline style buttons
- Button component `link` prop also binds `btn-unstyled` class

Fixed:

- Ember template compiler is no longer accidentally pulled into build
- Popovers expanding beyond height of body
- Safari not showing SVG bug due to removal of xlink:href

Updated:

- Ember v2.13

#### On `btn-unstyled`:

The button component `link=true` config is intended for creating a button element that
looks exactly like an anchor element. This is to create accessible triggers in the
app that are not links to other pages, but should look like links for UX reasons.
Although the Ember Radical styles handle this, using Radical with Bootstrap does not.
The `btn-unstyled` class is being added in this release. In v2 CSS will be added to
the component CSS that styles it like an anchor:

```css
.btn-unstyled {
  -webkit-appearance: none; // Remove Chrome native button styling
  white-space: normal;
  line-height: $line-height-base;
  vertical-align: baseline;
  user-select: auto;
  border: none;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: $font-family-sans-serif;
}
```

_These styles are not being added in 1.7 as they are considered a breaking change,
but can be added to any consuming app prior to 2.0 if wanted._
